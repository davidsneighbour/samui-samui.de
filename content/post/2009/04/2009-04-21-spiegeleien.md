Im Spiegel gibt es ein interessantes [Interview mit Sukhumbhand Paribatra][1], dem Governour Bangkoks und Cousins des KÃ¶nigs ([hier auf Deutsch][2]). Neben Thaksin und den Unruhen geht es dabei um die Thronfolge:

> <span class="caps">SPIEGEL</span>: You are a cousin of the king. So you know the royal court's rules very well. How is the successor to the king actually selected?
> 
> Sukhumbhand: There are generally two possibilities. The king can pick his own a successor ...
> 
> <span class="caps">SPIEGEL</span>: ... which King Bhumibol Adulyadej has not done yet ...
> 
> Sukhumbhand: As far as we know. If that hasn't happened, then a successor must be found according to the palace law of 1926. But that is subject to approval by the parliament.
> 
> <span class="caps">SPIEGEL</span>: So his son, Crown Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn, or one of his daughters would become the successor?
> 
> Sukhumbhand: No, the palace law doesn't permit a female successor to the throne.
> 
> <span class="caps">SPIEGEL</span>: So the only choice would be Crown Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn?
> 
> Sukhumbhand: That we know of, yes.

One of the better interviews about the red days... that we know of, yes...
