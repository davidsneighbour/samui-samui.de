The Administrative Reform Committee under the Constitutional Monarchy revoked the 1997 constitution following a power seizure yesterday.

In its third announcement, the committee also terminated the Senate, the House of Representatives, the cabinet and the Constitutional Court. Privy councilors remain in office and continue doing their duties, it said.

All courts other than the Constitutional Court still have the power to work on legal proceedings, according to the announcement.
