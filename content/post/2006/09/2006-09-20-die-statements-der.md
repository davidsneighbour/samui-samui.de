Leaders of Thailand&#8217;s military coup have released a series of statements. The initial statement and communiques 1 to 4 were read out on army television and a sixth statement appeared in English on the website of The Nation newspaper. The texts of the four statements follow: 

**<span class="caps">INITIAL</span> STATEMENT**
  
Now the Administrative Reform Group under the Democratic System with the King as the Head of State, comprising commanders of the armed forces and the National Police Bureau, has gained, without any resistance, full control of the situation in Bangkok Metropolis and nearby provinces. 

For the sake of maintaining peace and order in the country, people are asked to render their co-operation. We apologise for the inconvenience. 

**&#8216;No intention to rule&#8217;**
  
There has been social division like never before. Each side has been trying to conquer another with all possible means and the situation tends to intensify with growing doubts on the administration amid widespread reported corruption. 

State units and independent organisations have been politically meddled [with], not able to deliver their services as specified in the Constitution. 

The administration is also usually bordering on &#8220;lest majest&#8221; [as published] actions against the revered King. Despite attempts from social units for compromises, there is no way to end the conflicts. 

The revolution body thus needs to seize power. We have no intention to rule but to return the power to the people as soon as possible, to preserve peace and honour the King who is the most revered to all Thais. 

**<span class="caps">COMMUNIQUE</span> NO 1**
  
It has been clear that the administration of the country&#8217;s affairs by the current caretaker government has created conflicts and division, and sowed discord among the people of the nation. 

It is unprecedented in the history of the Thai nation that groups were determined to win through ways and means. 

The trend is getting more violent every passing day. 

The majority of the people are suspicious of extensive corruption and malfeasance practices among the bureaucracy. 

Independent agencies and organisations have been dominated by politics and unable to fulfil the objectives as stipulated in the constitution of the Kingdom of Thailand. 

Consequently, political activities have encountered numerous problems and obstacles. 

Frequently, the dignity of the Thai people&#8217;s king was affected. 

The efforts exerted by several sectors of society to alleviate the situation have failed to bring an end to the conflict. 

It is necessary for the Administrative Reform Group under the Democratic System with the King as the Head of State, comprising commanders of the armed forces and the National Police Bureau, to seize national administrative power from now on. 

In so doing, the Administrative Reform Group under the Democratic System with the King as the Head of State wishes to reaffirm that it has no intention to become the administrators of the country. 

The administrative power under the democratic system with the king as the head of the state will be returned to the Thai people as quickly as possible in order to maintain peace and order and preserve national stability, as well as to uphold the beloved institution of the monarchy of all the Thai people. 

**<span class="caps">COMMUNIQUE</span> NO 2**
  
All military and police personnel are ordered to report themselves to their respective commanding officers. 

All forces&#8217; movements from their barracks are strictly prohibited without orders from the Administrative Reform Group under the Democratic System with the King as the Head of State. 

**<span class="caps">COMMUNIQUE</span> NO 3**
  
The Administrative Reform Group Under the Democratic System with the King as the Head of State has successfully seized the administrative power of the country. 

To maintain peace and order, the Reform Group henceforth announces that: 

1) The Constitution of Thailand of BE 2540 (1997) is terminated. 

2) The Senate, the House of Representatives, the Cabinet, and the Constitutional Court are terminated along with the Constitution. 

3) The Privy Councillors are to continue in office. 

4) All the courts except the Constitutional Court are to continue to operate as normal according to the law and the announcement of the Reform Group. 

**<span class="caps">COMMUNIQUE</span> NO 4**
  
In compliance with some laws that prescribe the duties and authority of the prime minister and the ministers, the leader of the Administrative Reform Group under the Democratic System with the King as the Head of State Reform Group has issued the following orders: 

1) During the period in which the office of the prime minister is vacant, all the executive powers and duties that the law prescribed to a prime minister or the cabinet shall be delegated to the leader of the Reform Group and to those whom the leader of the Administrative Reform Group shall assign them. 

2) During the period in which the offices of the ministers are vacant, all the executive powers and duties prescribed by law to each and every minister shall be delegated to the permanent secretary of that respective ministry, except when otherwise ordered by the leader of the Administrative Reform Group.
