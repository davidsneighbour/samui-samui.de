[Netter Kommentar in The Nation][1] &uuml;ber das Leben mit einer nicht regierenden Regierung:

> Of course, if he [Thaksin] formally submitted his resignation, it would be a totally different story. At least, he wouldn&#8217;t be paid as a premier. He could take up a leadership position at Thai Rak Thai Party headquarters; perhaps his salary would come from his wife&#8217;s own purse. And newsmen would not have to go through the daily routine of reporting: &#8220;The caretaker premier who is on holiday refused to offer any comment on the issues of the day.&#8221; If the Thai Rak Thai leader says nothing meaningful, that&#8217;s not news; but if a country&#8217;s premier keeps shaking his head when asked about all the major happenings in the country, it makes a major headline on the 7 o&#8217;clock evening news. And that could very well shake the confidence of foreign investors who still don&#8217;t quite understand what&#8217;s really going on in this country.
