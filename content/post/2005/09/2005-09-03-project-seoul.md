Oh, did I tell already that I like photoblogs? It&#8217;s mainly because my own photos are the worst waste of harddrive space since mankind spotted the possibility to hold moments on pictures.

One of the blogs I often hit is [Matthews][1] [Project Seoul][2]. [Moments][3] [in][4] [time][5]. I like it. Because pictures can tell more than words. More than ever if you are in a world where you need three languages to say one thing.
