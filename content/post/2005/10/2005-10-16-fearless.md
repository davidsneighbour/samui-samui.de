So many little things followed me, So many little things that bothered me, But I found my answer, From all the chaos that followed me, I have found my answer, I&#8217;ve told you before don&#8217;t follow me, Because I am not your answer

I am not alone, I am not afraid, I am not unhappy, These are the words I say to myself everyday, I am not alone, I am not afraid, I am not unhappy, Tell me what ritual I should have today, But I&#8217;m not alone, I&#8217;ve resolved so many things and set myself free

I am not alone, I am not afraid, I am not unhappy, The words I say to myself every day, I am not alone, I am not afraid, I am not unhappy, Such a stupid ritual to have to say to myself everyday, I&#8217;m not alone but I found my answer and set myself free, I&#8217;m not unhappy

I&#8217;m not alone and I&#8217;m not unhappy, Not alone and I&#8217;m not unhappy, And I&#8217;m not afraid, not unhappy, I&#8217;m not alone, I&#8217;m not afraid, Eleven point two, eleven point two, I&#8217;m not alone, I&#8217;m not afraid, I&#8217;m not alone, I&#8217;m not afraid

I&#8217;m not afraid. I&#8217;m not afraid, I am not alone. I am not afraid. I am not unhappy, These are the words I say to myself everyday, I am not alone. I am not afraid. I am not unhappy, I&#8217;m not afraid

And I am not alone. I am not afraid. I&#8217;m not unhappy, The words I say to myself everyday, I am not alone. I am not afraid. I am not unhappy, Such a stupid ritual to have to say to myself everyday, I&#8217;m not alone but I found my answer and set myself free, I&#8217;m not, I&#8217;m not, I&#8217;m not unhappy.
