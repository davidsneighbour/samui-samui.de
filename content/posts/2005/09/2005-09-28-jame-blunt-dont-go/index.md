And dont forget, i'll be watching you, And the meaning of your motives will come shining through,

Is it a warning, is it an evil sign, is it a people, who had lost their mind, is it the darkness, is it a man resigned, is it a best friend leaving you behind

And don't forget that i'll be watching you, and the meaning of your motives will come shinning through...

Is it a warning, is it an evil sign, is it a people, who had lost their mind, is it the darkness, is it a man resigned, is it a best friend leaving you behind, is it a good thing, is it a gifting kind, is it a profit with a one track mind, is it the finish, is it a fearful find, is it the centre as your brain unwinds...

Don't go where you been before, dont go sleeping on the floor, dont go down on dirty whores, dont lose your self

is it evil, is it gunna make u sick, is now a time that you realise that you betta get out quick, is it hunger is it making you feel pain, did u give u all, cuz ur only small and now your bodys drained, is it ever gunna stop, will they ever let u go, you're in a rush, they dont care enough, and theyre thinking very slow, time is ticking on, we dont get a second shot and in 60 years,we gotta face our fears, and show the cards we've got...

Don't go where you been before, dont go sleeping on the floor, dont go down on dirty whores, dont lose your self
